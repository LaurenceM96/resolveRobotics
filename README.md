# Resolve Robotics

## First Impressions
In this readMe I'll just be laying out my thoughts as I approach the problem so you can see my working and thinking as I go along.

The first thing I notice from the outline is that the buttons do not work as expected. I'll be sorting that first, as it needs to work intuitively since its an
educational tool. I believe there should be a forward button, which moves the turtle forward in the direction it is facing, and rotation buttons so that its
direction can be changed. I might make some adjustments to this based on how it feels.<br>
Also, it needs to look like a turtle, obviously. So I'll find a turtle sprite and be implementing that.
