# Roaming Space Turtle

## Instructions

The game begins with a blank page, the user can move forward, rotate left 90 degrees, or rotate right 90 degrees using the top 3 buttons. Below those buttons you will find three more buttons: Start Programming, Play, and Reset. Start programming will disable the first 3 movement buttons, but instead, your actions will be scheduled to play when the "Play" button is pressed. Reset will reset the turtle to its starting position and clear all lines and scheduled commands.<br><br>

There is one last button you will find right at the bottom, "Space Turtles". This is a simple game mode where the user must use their roaming space turtle to eat all of the asteroids.

## Notes

The code and the game in general is very rough around the edges, but given the time frame I simply wanted to fit as many functional features in as I could. There are many more things I wanted to implement but simply didnt have time, these include:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Pen up and pen down - I feel this would be fairly easy to add as of right now, but without colours and being able to input angles, seems a bit useless.</li>
    <li>Colours - This in conjunction with being able to input smaller angles and step size would mean the user could draw things. Instead of creativity I seemed to gravitate towards a game like setup instead.</li>
    <li>Being able to input smaller step sizes and angles.</li>
    <li>Game over and Win screens on the space turtles game - This would be a nice feature to make the game more interesting. I feel like the game should be game over if the user steps off screen.</li>
    <li>Shortest path algorithm - This would add another element to the game so the user has to try and find the shortest path to get all of the asteroids.</li>
</ul>
